## attainU maze problem
A solution to the coding assessment of the Attain U maze problem

# Built Purely on React
The app is built using React and it's practices. This particular app uses State components and Lifecycle to manage the Keyboard events. 

# Improvements
Due to the lack of time there are a few aspects that could be improved.
  - If the user doesn't enter a number or cancels the error is not caught, hence an errorBoundary class ideally would have been implemented.
  - Stylization could be improved
